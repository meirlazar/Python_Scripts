Issue: 
On 5/18/2019 at 7:43AM EST, Raymond Agueros reported to Richard Marley and myself that Lou Rivera, John Musco and Raymond had KVM issues the prior night and were not able to get into their KVMs. Chaz, Lou, John and Raymond spent over two hours trying to resolve the issue and John was able to get around the issue by removing the Symantec program from the IBM PC (Windows 10 laptop, not the KVM).

Resolution: 
After Lou and Raymond removed Symantec (from the IBM host Windows 10 laptop) via the control panel they were able to successfully bring up KVM and all related items. He relayed this information to Earl and TIm(they had the same issue when they tried to get into KVM.

RCA:
IBM Updates ran on the host laptops attempting to update/install SEP. There is already Windows Defender running on the laptops, causing the conflict.
